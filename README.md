# Delivery-Time-Estimation-through-Feature-Engineering

🚚 Delivery Time Estimation through Feature Engineering

This repository contains a data-driven project aimed at predicting delivery times using structured feature engineering techniques on logistics-related datasets. The goal is to improve delivery forecasting and operational efficiency through robust preprocessing and data transformation.

📌 Objective

To build a foundation for accurate delivery time estimation using cleaned and enriched features extracted from raw delivery records, leveraging a structured data engineering pipeline.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Google Colab

Machine Learning Models (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)

🔍 Core Focus Areas
Column Profiling: Analyzed dataset columns to understand semantics and prepare for transformation.

Data Cleaning: Treated missing values and handled outliers using hypothesis testing and distributional analysis.

Feature Engineering:
- Created new informative features (e.g., total distance, time difference, encoded categorical variables).
- Performed date-time transformation and geolocation-based calculations.

Modeling: 
- Trained multiple regression models to estimate delivery time.
- Selected the best-performing model based on R², MAE, and RMSE metrics.

📊 Results & Insights
Significant improvement in model performance post feature engineering.

Best Model Achieved:

R² Score (Test): 0.83

MAE: ~15 minutes

RMSE: ~20 minutes

Key predictive features included total distance, pickup and drop-off time windows, and order category.

🔭 Future Enhancements

Integration with real-time GPS tracking APIs for dynamic updates.

Deployment via Flask/Streamlit as an end-user application.

Add model explainability using SHAP values or feature importance plots.
